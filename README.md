# Age Estimation using VGG16

This repository contains three Mathematica codes for predicting human age from facial images using a pre-trained VGG16 model. The datasets used are Adience, UTKFace, and CACD.

## Files
- `Adience_dataset.nb`: Runs age estimation on Adience dataset.
- `UTKFace_dataset.nb`: Runs age estimation on UTKFace dataset.
- `CACD_dataset.nb`: Runs age estimation on CACD dataset.

Each script calculates MAE, MSE, RMSE, Bias, Standard Deviation of Errors, R² Score, and ±5 years accuracy.
